People can be hard on themselves because they criticize others too much. In a professional or work environment, I find myself to be one of the people who initiate encouragement and helpful feedback but only when the timing allows or if it's within my experience to be able to help or give additional tools that can aide. So that others won't feel patronized or used. I never condone idle gossiping and mocking, it holds as I've mentioned yesterday, a menacing or controlling energy that only contributes to an atmosphere of fear and disrespect of others. Generally speaking and this is not to report anything from my own background, but I admittedly get to become cruel/malevolent myself when people are mean to me, being bigoted or thoughtless with the way they choose their outcasts or fools to malign.
 
My stand is: everyone has their flaws. It doesn't have to be a running joke or topic of conversation when it comes to fulfilling tasks, most especially, because the work itself (as I have posted on my MS Teams status all the time, and to quote Kahlil Gibran) is love made visible, and moves as the earth does. It is nothing to complain about and there is proper attitude about it without finding ways - or even other people - to feel ungrateful.
